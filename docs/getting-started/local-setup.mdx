This page will walk you through the installation of Dara framework and the creation of a simple 'Hello World' app.

## Requirements

There are two prerequisites to being able to use the Dara framework:

- Python v3.8+
- NodeJS v14+ (Don't worry you don't need to understand any JS, this is used to build the application in production mode)

You can install both of these via the Homebrew package manager on MacOS or follow the instructions on their
websites: [Python](https://www.Python.org/about/gettingstarted/) [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have these tools installed the best way is to create a Python virtual environment or start a new
Python Poetry project so that our dependencies don't conflict with anything you have installed on your wider system.

## Installation - Starting a new project

There are two methods in which you can start a new Dara project:

- The first is through using the CLI for creating apps.
- The second is by manually starting a project with `poetry` or `pip`.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="cli"
    values={[{label: 'CLI Quickstart', value: 'cli'}, {label: 'Poetry Quickstart', value: 'Poetry'}, {label: 'Pip Quickstart', value: 'pip'}]}
>
<TabItem value="cli">

The CLI can be installed globally with the help of the `pipx` package which installs it in an isolated virtual environment and makes it available just like any other global binary.

`pipx` installation instructions [are available here](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/) but the short version is:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

You might need to **restart your terminal** after installing `pipx`. The `ensurepath` command adds necessary directories to your `PATH`, the changes might not be reflected in your terminal until you restart it.

To install the CLI globally with the `pipx` package, run the following command:

```bash
pipx install create-dara-app
```

You should see a message saying that the CLI has been installed successfully. Check that the CLI is available by running the following command:

```bash
create-dara-app --version
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Poetry">

Poetry can be installed following these [instructions](https://Python-Poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/). You can
then create a new Poetry project with the following command:

```sh
poetry init
```

This will step you through creating a new project and it will create a virtual environment for you in the
background. Next you will need to change the Python version in your generated `pyproject.toml` file to the following:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.8,<3.12.0"
```

You are now ready to install the core of the Dara framework:

```sh
poetry add dara-core --extras all
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pip">

You can create a virtual environment with the following command:

```sh
python3 -m venv dara_venv
```

This will create a virtual environment in your current working directory. You can then activate that environment with
the following command:

```sh
source dara_venv/bin/activate
```

You are now ready to install the core of the Dara framework:

```sh
pip install dara-core[all]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hello World

You will now create one of the simplest application that you can make with the Dara framework.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="cli"
    values={[{label: 'CLI Quickstart', value: 'cli'}, {label: 'Manual Quickstart', value: 'manual'}]}
>
<TabItem value="cli">

To create a "Hello World" app simply type in your terminal and follow the prompts:

```bash
create-dara-app
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual">

Create a folder in your project with the same name as the project itself.

:::warning
The folder cannot have hyphens, and therefore you must substitute `-` for `_`. For example, the `first-dashboard` project will have a `first_dashboard` subfolder.
:::

Under this folder add a `main.py` file and copy the following snippet into it.

```python
from dara.core import ConfigurationBuilder
from dara.components import Heading

# Here you initialize the app config, which uses a Builder pattern to
# build up the app piece by piece.
config = ConfigurationBuilder()

# Here you add a single page to the application, with a title of 'Hello World'
# and the text 'Hello World!' on the page.
config.add_page('Hello World', Heading('Hello World!'))
```

:::note
Dara expects configuration to be available as a `config` variable in `{root_package}/main.py` by default.

As an example, in a project called `test-application`
your code should be in `(...)/test-application/test_application/main.py`. Take note of the dash being replaced by an underscore in the package name.

The default behaviour can be overriden using the `--config` CLI flag.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Running your application

Once you've got your project setup will want to run the application so you can see your application in action. This can be done with a single command from the root of your project:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="Poetry"
    groupId="packageManager"
    values={[ {label: 'Poetry', value: 'Poetry'}, {label: 'Pip', value: 'pip'}]}
>

<TabItem value="Poetry">

If you have used the CLI you can skip this step, as it automatically installs the dependencies. Otherwise install the dependencies:

```sh
poetry install
```

To start the app:

```sh
poetry run dara start --reload
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pip">

Within the `venv` created earlier then:

```sh
dara start --reload
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The `--reload` flag here will cause it to automatically reload the backend and UI whenever any changes are made and saved.
:::

This command will start a local development server and will start your application at `http://localhost:8000` and it
should look like the below:
