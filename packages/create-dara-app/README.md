### Build decision apps in Python

_Tap into the power of causality by transforming data into interactive graphs and applications_

Dara is a dynamic application framework designed for creating interactive web apps with ease, all in pure Python. Over the past two years, Dara has fueled the development of hundreds of apps, now widely used and appreciated by both our customers and our in-house teams!

## Quickstart

To install the package, run:

```bash
pip install create-dara-app
```

That's it! You can now use the `create-dara-app` CLI tool to create a new app.

```bash
create-dara-app
```
